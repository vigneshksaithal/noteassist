This package provides types for the Highlight runtime API. Highlight is an app platform for AI apps that allows you to quickly build context aware apps. For example, you could use the runtime API to build a task list app that automatically assembles tasks based on your screen contents.

Learn more about Highlight at our website: [https://highlight.ing](https://highlight.ing).

## Using the Runtime

Please read over the [developer documentation for the runtime API](https://docs.highlight.ing/learn/developers/runtime-api) to get started.

You can access the TypeDoc for this library [here](https://highlight-ing.github.io/highlight/app-runtime/).

Under the hood, this library just accesses the Highlight runtime API via the `globalThis.highlight` object. This object will only be available when running inside of the Highlight app. All methods will throw an Error if you attempt to call them from outside of Highlight.
